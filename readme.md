## Info

This is my version of [Visual Poi](https://www.lighttoys.cz/product/visual-poi-v4-classic/) which were mad expensive so I made my own

Shout out to [Pov Pixel Poi PJRC forum thread](https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/30020-Teensy-APA102-POV-Poi-Pixel-Poi-Build-Tutorial) I couldn't have made these without them

The Poi uses a teensy 3.2, a strip of APA201 LEDs and a TP4056 LiPo charger

Things to do
* Guide
* How to install and run the code
* Link to the image converted (Talk about it)
